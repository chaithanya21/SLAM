# SLAM
**Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping(SLAM)** is a **Robust** method for tracking an object over time and mapping its sorroundings using elements of **Probablilty ,Motion Models and Linear Algebra**.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on implementing a **GRAPH SLAM** for a 2 dimensional world by combining the robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.**SLAM** gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an **active area of research** in the fields of **robotics** and **autonomous systems.**

Below is an example of a 2D robot world with landmarks (purple x's) and the robot (a red 'o') located and found using only sensor and motion data collected by that robot. This is just one example for a 50x50 grid world; This project will likely able to generate a variety of these maps.
