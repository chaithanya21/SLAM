# SLAM
**Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping(SLAM)** is a **Robust** method for tracking an object over time and mapping its sorroundings using elements of **Probablilty ,Motion Models and Linear Algebra**.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on implementing a **GRAPH SLAM** for a 2 dimensional world by combining the robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.**SLAM** gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an **active area of research** in the fields of **robotics** and **autonomous systems.**
